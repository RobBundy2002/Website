                    <p>
                        Now currently living full time in Charlottesville, I'm originally from the small town of Lebanon 
                        in Southwest Virginia. In May of 2025 I graduated from the University of Virginia with a 
                        Bachelor's of Arts in Computer Science and a minor in Religious Studies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Summer 2025 I will start my career as a Software Developer for General Atomics Integrated Intelligence.
                        In Fall 2025, I‚Äôll be kicking off my Online Masters in Computer Science Program at Georgia Tech.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I‚Äôm passionate about game dev, app building, and keeping my personal web projects fresh.
                        Outside the screen, I‚Äôm probably on a disc golf course, listening to music, or playing hoops
                        at the UVA gym.
